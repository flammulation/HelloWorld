# HelloWorld
Testing node.js applications for the classic "Hello World" example.

I am running REHL 7.0 with node.js for the server setup. Also, you will need to install express and ejs for the routing and templating. 

To run the app, I am using forever on /HelloWorld/hello_world5.js


#UPDATE 4/10/18
the weather functionality is working based on US zip code. Next update will be to improve the UI and allow international zip codes.
